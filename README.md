Academic Achievement Monitor - Power BI Dashboard

Project Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of student performance based on multiple key factors such as gender, parental education, 
subject-wise scores, and grade distribution. The dashboard is designed to help educators and analysts gain actionable insights into student achievements, 
identify performance trends,and make data-driven decisions for academic improvement.

Key Features & Insights
 Dynamic KPIs – Displaying total student count, gender distribution, total marks, and average marks.
 Gender-Based Performance Analysis – A comparative analysis of math and science scores for male and female students.
 Parental Education Impact – Understanding how a student’s performance is influenced by their parents’ education level.
 Grade Distribution Visualization – Identifying the proportion of students in different grade categories (A, B, C, etc.).
 Slicer & Filtering Options – Users can filter by gender, parental education level, and grades for a customized view of the data.

What I Did in This Project?
 Designed an aesthetic and professional dashboard with well-structured visuals.
 Cleaned and transformed student performance data for accurate analysis.
 Implemented DAX calculations to derive key performance metrics (e.g., average marks).
 Used interactive charts and filters to enhance data exploration.
 Focused on data-driven storytelling, making insights easy to interpret.

Why This Project Stands Out?
 Real-World Application – Helps institutions track student progress and optimize learning strategies.
 Business Intelligence Approach – Demonstrates proficiency in Power BI, DAX, and data visualization.
 Strategic Decision-Making – Enables stakeholders to make data-driven educational improvements.

Technical Skills Used
 Power BI – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation
 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures and KPIs
 Data Cleaning & Transformation – Ensuring data accuracy and consistency
 Business Intelligence & Storytelling – Presenting insights effectively
